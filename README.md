# Employee Directory Manager

  ## Description

  I created this Employee generator as a way to simplify the management of a companies directory and org chart. Every company whether its 5 employees or 5000 employees needs a simple way to manage the departments, roles, and employee data in their organization. This application is designed for Human resource departments or team managers to simplify the process of keeping track of their team members. You can view, add, update, and remove most records in an employee directory using this application. When writing this application I needed to learn how to create, read, update, and delete data records in order to write a functioning directory manager. This application will give you many of the tools needed to manage your organization.
